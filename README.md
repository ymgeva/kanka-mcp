# Kanka MCP - Model Context Protocol Server for Kanka API

This project provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for interacting with the [Kanka](https://kanka.io) API. It allows AI assistants to manage campaigns, characters, locations, posts, notes, and journals in your Kanka worldbuilding projects.

## Features

The server provides tools for working with:
- Campaigns: List all user campaigns
- Characters: List, retrieve, create, update, and delete characters
- Locations: List, retrieve, create, update, and delete locations 
- Posts: List, retrieve, create, update, and delete posts for any entity
- Notes: List, retrieve, create, update, and delete notes
- Journals: List, retrieve, create, update, and delete journals

All create and update operations properly handle HTML content for description fields and support privacy settings.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - A fast Python package installer and resolver

### Installation with UV

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kanka_mcp.git
   cd kanka_mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies with UV:
   ```
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or if you have a pyproject.toml file:
   ```
   uv pip install .
   ```

### Configuration

You need to set the `KANKA_API_KEY` environment variable with your Kanka API key:

```bash
export KANKA_API_KEY=your_kanka_api_key
```

To get your Kanka API key:
1. Log in to your Kanka account
2. Go to "Account Settings"
3. Navigate to the "API" section
4. Create or copy your API token

## Usage

### Running the MCP Server

Run the server directly with:

```bash
python kanka_mcp.py
```

Or using UV:

```bash
uv run kanka_mcp.py
```

### Adding to MCP Server Configuration

Add the following to your MCP server configuration:

```json
"kanka": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
        "--directory",
        "FULL_PATH_TO_SCRIPT_FOLDER",
        "run",
        "kanka_mcp.py"
    ],
    "env": {
        "KANKA_API_KEY": "YOUR_KANKA_API_KEY"
    }
}
```

Replace `FULL_PATH_TO_SCRIPT_FOLDER` with the absolute path to the directory containing the `kanka_mcp.py` script, and `YOUR_KANKA_API_KEY` with your actual Kanka API key.
